Hello!, my name is Pong-pol Pol-ard. 👀 If you want to have a quick look about me you can skipped to conclusion part. 🤗


## 🚀 About Me
I have some mental issues and need to drop out for 2 years when I about to graduate high school. Then I came back and learn Non-Formal Education(กศน.) to be equivalent before I get in Chiang Mai University as Computer Engineer Major.

At first, I can learn normally because it was online from COVID-19, but after 1 years of learning and need to be on-site...
I need to drop out (again with mental issues). And now i decided to not get back there.

Anyway, I'm better now. I'm now learning Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, And planned for more! I have decided to learn by my own paces from online courses and now seek for some jobs to do too (to keep myself active).
